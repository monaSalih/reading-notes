#### JupyterLab enables you to work with:
1. documents
2. activities such as:
      * Jupyter notebooks 
      * text editors
      * terminals
      * custom components in a flexible.


Easly arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters, for example:
1. Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output.

2. Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.

3. Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.

4. Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. 

>JupyterLab understands many file formats (images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, Vega, Vega-Lite, etc.)
