# Best Whiteboard Interview Advice
## 1-Communicate!
The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice
- First, Restate the Question
- Ask About Edge Cases
- Ask About Test Cases
- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
- Stuck? Ask for Help!
* Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
