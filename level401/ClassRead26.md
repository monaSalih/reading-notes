## How Django Works Behind the Scenes

**Django** is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram.It is open source.

 all open source projects, the two major issues that crop up are:
 1. funding.
 2. control.
 
**why does an open-source project need funding?**

* It turns out that while writing code is fun and developers are generally willing to contribute their time for free to do so.
* there are a host of decidedly less fun tasks needed to maintain and sustain an open source project.
1. handling any legal/trademark issues.
2. triaging tickets.
3. guiding community discussions.
4. organizing conferences.
5. managing release

 As a result, almost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved such as:

1) Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged.

2) Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel. 

3) Non-profit - This was Djangoâ€™s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.
