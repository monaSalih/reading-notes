# Forms


In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms, when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists

## How Forms Work

![aa4](aa4.PNG)

## Form Structure

## <form>

Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too

## Text Input

## <input 
The element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.

## type="text"
When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.

## Password Input

 type="password" When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out. They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords

## Text Area

The element is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag.

* Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element. 

* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs. X Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.

## Styling Forms

CSS is commonly used to control the appearance of form elements. This is both to make them more attractive and to make them more consistent across different browsers


 It is most common to style:
● Text inputs and text areas 
● Submit buttons
● Labels on forms, to get the form controls to align nicely
