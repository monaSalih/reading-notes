## wireframe: 
### Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design and plan the layout and interaction of your interface, also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

 ## Examples of wireframes
  ** some examples of wireframes: **

  1. Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change
  2. With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design.
  3. Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

  ## What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process
  following are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:
  * Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
* Sketch > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
* Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## The best tools for wireframing

There are heaps of free tools out there for creating wireframes and prototypes, The examples below all have free trials, so check them out!:
* UXPin: UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.

* InVision: InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!

* Wireframe.cc: Wireframe.cc provides you with the technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser, the online version of pen and paper.

How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. 1. Do your research
2. 2. Prepare your research for quick reference
3. 3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

# HTML
## So what is HTML?
is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. Consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.
for example follwing line how we can convert to HTML:

```
My cat is very grumpy
convert it to html line:
<p>My cat is very grumpy</p>
```
# Anatomy of an HTML element
Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.
![html]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png)

## The main parts of our element are as follows:

1. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.

2. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
3. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.


Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:
![html2]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png)

attribute should always have the following:

* A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

# Nesting elements
You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. like following:

	``` <p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>
  
  # Empty elements

  Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page:
  ```
   <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
   ```
