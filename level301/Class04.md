 # React and Forms
 
 * What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
✔ A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

* Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why
✔ the state will update when user submit ,brcouse the input control the component state

* How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
✔ using function

* Why would we use a ternary operator?
The ternary operator is an operator that takes three arguments. The first argument is a comparison argument, the second is the result upon a true comparison, and the third is the result upon a false comparison. 


* 
```
if(x===y) ? console.log(true); :  console.log(false);
```
