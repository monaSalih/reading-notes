# NOSQL


NOSQL VS SQL

NOSQL | SQL
------------ | -------------
NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. | SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data. |  databases have predefined schema
horizontally scalable | are vertically scalable
 examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb | examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
databases are not good fit for complex queries. | are good fit for the complex query intensive environmen

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
✔ vertically scalabl 
Give a real world example.
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example?
✔ SQL database examples: MySql
✔  NoSQL database examples: MongoDB

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
✔ NoSql
Which type of database is best for scalability?
✔ NoSql




# Conclution
What does SQL stand for?
✔ Structured Query Language

What is a realational database?
✔  is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
✔  logical data structures

What is a ‘schema’?
✔ can refer to a visual representation of a database, a set of rules that govern a database, or to the entire set of objects belonging to a particular use.

What is a NoSQL database?
✔ also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases. 

Howo does it work?
✔ Each of the systems labelled with the generic name works differently, but the basic idea is to offer better scalability and performance by using DB models that don't support all the functionality of a generic RDBMS, but still enough functionality to be useful. In a way it's like MySQL, which at one time lacked support for transactions but, exactly because of that, managed to outperform other DB systems. If you could write your app in a way that didn't require transactions, it was great 

What is inside of a Mongo database?
✔  is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents 

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
in my opnion nosql becouse built data with relationship bettwen store item

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
✔ NoSQL is Low Cos 
✔ Scalability is Easier
