# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript


###  What is functional programming?

✔  is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles (listed above). Other examples of programming paradigms include object oriented programming and procedural programming.

### What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
 A pure function is a function which:

* Given the same inputs, always returns the same output 

* Has no side-effects
```
also ,Pure functions have lots of properties that are important in functional programming, including referential transparency (you can replace a function call with its resulting value without changing the meaning of the program).
```

* What are the benefits of a pure function?
✔ Pure functions are used heavily in Functional Programming. And, libraries such as ReactJS and Redux require the use of pure functions.

✔ pure functions can also be used in regular JavaScript that doesn’t depend on a single programming paradigm. 

What is immutability?
✔ An immutable object is an object that can’t be modified after it’s created. Conversely, a mutable object is any object which can be modified after it’s created.

* What is Referential transparency?

✔ is generally defined as the fact that an expression, in a program, may be replaced by its value (or anything having the same value) without changing the result of the program. This implies that methods should always return the same value for a given argument, without having any other effect. 


## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners (Modules and require)

* What is a module?
✔ A module is a piece of code that encapsulates the code for specific functionality. It makes it easy to write decoupled and easy maintainable and testable code.

* What does the word ‘require’ do?

✔ function is the easiest way to include modules that exist in separate files. 

* How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
  
  ✔ need to _ import _ it

* What do we have to do to make a module available?
we need to export them
