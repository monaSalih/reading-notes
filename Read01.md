# Mastering Markdown

### *Markdown*
is is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document;
formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just 
a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular 
text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

**also we can use Markdown in:**

* Gists

* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests 

* Files with the .md or .markdown extension
 
 for more information you can visit [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/)
  
  These how you can use it:

  
> Headers
```
  #This is an h1 tag
 
##This is an h2 tag
 
######This is an h6 tag
```
  
> Emphasis
```
* This text will be italic *
_ This will also be italic _

** This text will be bold **
__ This will also be bold __
```

> Lists 
Unordered 
 ```
*Item 1
*Item 2 
```
  
> Ordered
 ```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3.Item 3
  ```
 ### Blockquotes
``` As Kanye West said:
>We're living the future so
>the present is our past.
  ``` 
 ### Inline code
``` 
I think you should use an
> element here instead.
``` 
  
>images
  
 ```javascript
 ![ image name]( but the image link )
```
  
  
  ## GitHub Flavored Markdown
Some features of GitHub Flavored Markdown are only available in the descriptions 
  and comments of Issues and Pull Requests. These include @mentions as well as
  references to SHA-1 hashes, Issues, and Pull Requests. Task Lists are also
  available in Gist comments and in Gist Markdown files.
  
  >Table
  ```javascript
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```
  
>Username @mentions 
  Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.
  
 >Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (page link) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
